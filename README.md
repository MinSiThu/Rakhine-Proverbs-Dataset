Rakhine is a language in Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia.
The official language of Myanmar is Burmese, a low-resource language.

Rakhine, aka, Arakanese language, mainly used by the Rakhine people in the Rakhine State of Myanmar, is also a low-resource language. Thus, the research and applications to explore the Rakhine language are very limited to move on.

I release this "Rakhine Proverbs" dataset for further research and studies in the Rakhine language under a **public domain** license.

The proverbs are summarized and extracted from "ဥပမာစုံ၊ ရခိုင်စကားပုံ။" ကျမ်း by "အရှင်စက္ကိန္ဒ, အရှင်ဝါသဝ" published in 1996, August.
